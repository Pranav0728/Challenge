# User Management Application

This is a simple user management application built with **Next.js** and **React**. It allows you to manage user data by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app also supports authentication via **NextAuth** and provides toast notifications to show the status of actions such as adding, updating, and deleting users.

## Features

- **Add User**: Add a new user with name and date of birth.
- **Edit User**: Update user information such as name and date of birth.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the list.
- **Toast Notifications**: Inform the user about the success or failure of actions.
- **Loading State**: Skeleton loaders are shown while fetching data.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and building the app.
- **React** for building the user interface.
- **NextAuth** for user authentication.
- **React Toastify** for toast notifications.
- **React Loading Skeleton** for skeleton loaders.
- **MongoDB** (or your preferred database) for storing user data.
